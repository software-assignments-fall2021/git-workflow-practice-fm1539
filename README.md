Comment: What I found fascinating about the article is that software engineers nowadays can find careers in a variety of industries:  technology, healthcare, automotive manufacturing, green energy, remote sensing, aeronautics, government, non-profit, and finance. I also now seem to understand a bit more when it comes to the differences between a software engineer and a systems engineer.
